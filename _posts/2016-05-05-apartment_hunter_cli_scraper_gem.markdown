  My first foray into building a gem was a fantastic learning experience! Really helped me to understand where I was lacking with regard to class scope and overall OO design. I obviously have a lot to learn, as well as some further refactoring to do, but this was hands down the best thing I have one in my quest to become more proficient in Ruby. Check out my gem on https://rubygems.org/gems/apartmenthunter or install it by running 'gem install apartmenthunter' and then running the command 'apartmenthunter' in your terminal!

Thanks for reading!
