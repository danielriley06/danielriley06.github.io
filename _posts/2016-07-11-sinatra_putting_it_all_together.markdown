Confession time, I took a lonnnnnnngggggggg time completing the sinatra assessment. A mix of family emergencies, being a perfectionist (at times :P ), a dash of frustration with sinatra after having experience with Rails, and one helping of laziness all led to me spending roughly a month on the assessment. 

But I learned a TON. So at the end of the day, all's well that end's well. I just finished my site tonight, so I plan to come back and add more to this post ASAP tomorrow. Hopefully helping one or two of you with getting through some of the nuances of Sinatra.
